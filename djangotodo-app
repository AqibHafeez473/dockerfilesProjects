Django-Todo Repository:
GitHub URL: github.com/shreys7/django-todo.git
  Step 1: Creating a Directory on Your AWS EC2 Instance
Before we can start working with GitHub repositories, creating a dedicated directory on your AWS EC2 instance where you want to store your project files is a good practice. You can do this using the following commands:


COPY
mkdir project-directory
cd project-directory
Replace project-directory with a suitable name for your project directory.

Step 2: Cloning GitHub Repositories
Once you have your project directory set up, you can clone the GitHub repositories into it. Run the following commands for each repository:


COPY

git clone https://github.com/shreys7/django-todo.git
These commands will fetch and store the repository code within your project directory on your AWS EC2 instance.
